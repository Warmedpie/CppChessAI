# CppChessAI
A basic Chess AI made in c++

Basic Chess AI, if you want to use this AI to get worse at chess you are free to do so.

use the continous analysis function is mostly for testing, it will calculate until it finds mate, using this will freeze the application until a mate in found and is not reccomended for use at any time

The Depth is how many ply the bot looks into the future

The book moves are all self programmed and do not include that many variations but should be enough to escape the opening, will slowly add more.

The engine auto queens, this will most likely be expanded into full promotions in the future.

Use the "Toggle engine" buttons to make the engine suggest moves, if you want to use the continuous analysis mode that is also fine but know the process will freeze until a forced checkmate is found, this will be expanded on and fixed in the future but is mostly used for testing right now
